# 42-cpp-01
# Welcome to the Spooky World of C++! üéÉüëª

Say hello to **CPP Module 01**! It‚Äôs a magical collection of exercises to transport you into the enchanted realm of C++. Here, you‚Äôll discover the secrets of memory allocation, unlock the mysteries of pointers to members, master the art of references, and conquer the powerful switch statements.

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Objective**: Bring the undead to life by creating a zombie class! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, includes:

1. **Zombie Characteristics**:
   - **Name**: Every zombie needs a cool (or spooky) name! This will be stored as a string attribute.

2. **Zombie Announcements**:
   - **`void announce(void)`**: Each zombie must introduce themselves with flair by saying: `NameOfTheZombie: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...`

3. **Zombie Creation**:
   - **`Zombie* newZombie(std::string name)`**: This function will summon a new zombie, bestow it with a name, and return the terrifying creature to you.
   - **`void randomChump(std::string name)`**: This function will randomly summon a zombie, name it, and have it proudly announce its arrival.

The true magic of these exercises lies in understanding how to allocate memory either on the stack or the heap. You'll become a wizard of memory management!

## Files You‚Äôll Need:
- **Makefile**: The spellbook that compiles your code.
- **main.cpp**: The grand stage where your zombies come to life.
- **Zombie.cpp**: The hidden chamber where you define your zombie class.
- **newZombie.cpp**: The secret lair where new zombies are created.
- **randomChump.cpp**: The surprise party room where random zombies are summoned.
- **Zombie.hpp**: The ancient scroll that contains the declarations of your zombie class.

**Forbidden Spells**: None! You‚Äôre free to unleash your creativity with no restrictions!



## Exercise 01: Moar Brainz! üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüß†

**Objective**: Summon a massive horde of zombies in this thrilling exercise! Get ready to unleash an army of the undead.

To conjure up your terrifying legion, you need to implement the following magical function:

```cpp
Zombie* zombieHorde(int N, std::string name);
```

## Exercise 02: HI THIS IS BRAIN üß†üéâ

**Objective**: Dive into the fascinating world of C++ references and address pointers! Let's unravel the mysteries together.

## Mission Brief:
We need to create a program that showcases the difference between references and address pointers. Here's what you need to include in your code:

1. **String Setup**:
   - A string initialized to `"HI THIS IS BRAIN"`.

2. **Pointers and References**:
   - **`stringPTR`**: A pointer to our brainy string.
   - **`stringREF`**: A reference to the same string.

## The Program's Tasks:
Our program should print out the following:

1. The **memory address** of the string variable.
2. The **memory address** held by `stringPTR`.
3. The **memory address** held by `stringREF`.
4. The **value** of the string variable.
5. The **value** pointed to by `stringPTR`.
6. The **value** pointed to by `stringREF`.

## Files You‚Äôll Need:
- **Makefile**: The enchanted spellbook that compiles your code.
- **main.cpp**: The grand stage where our references and pointers perform their magic.

**Forbidden Spells**: None! You have complete creative freedom.
