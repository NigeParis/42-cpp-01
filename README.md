# 42-cpp-01
# Welcome to the Spooky World of C++! 🎃👻

Say hello to **CPP Module 01**! It’s a magical collection of exercises to transport you into the enchanted realm of C++. Here, you’ll discover the secrets of memory allocation, unlock the mysteries of pointers to members, master the art of references, and conquer the powerful switch statements.

## Exercise 00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ 🧟‍♂️

**Objective**: Bring the undead to life by creating a zombie class! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, includes:

1. **Zombie Characteristics**:
   - **Name**: Every zombie needs a cool (or spooky) name! This will be stored as a string attribute.

2. **Zombie Announcements**:
   - **`void announce(void)`**: Each zombie must introduce themselves with flair by saying: `NameOfTheZombie: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ...`

3. **Zombie Creation**:
   - **`Zombie* newZombie(std::string name)`**: This function will summon a new zombie, bestow it with a name, and return the terrifying creature to you.
   - **`void randomChump(std::string name)`**: This function will randomly summon a zombie, name it, and have it proudly announce its arrival.

The true magic of these exercises lies in understanding how to allocate memory either on the stack or the heap. You'll become a wizard of memory management!

## Files You’ll Need:
- **Makefile**: The spellbook that compiles your code.
- **main.cpp**: The grand stage where your zombies come to life.
- **Zombie.cpp**: The hidden chamber where you define your zombie class.
- **newZombie.cpp**: The secret lair where new zombies are created.
- **randomChump.cpp**: The surprise party room where random zombies are summoned.
- **Zombie.hpp**: The ancient scroll that contains the declarations of your zombie class.

**Forbidden Spells**: None! You’re free to unleash your creativity with no restrictions!

Ready to dive into the world of C++ and create your horde of zombies? Let’s get coding and bring those zombies to life! 🧟‍♀️👻
